   | 12/08/2023 | Updated to match the new changes done for v2.0.0. The code is a complete overhaul of the Taylor Made Code backend system. Some of the major changes, Swapped the UI system from the Dear ImGui derived system to the new Unity UI Toolkit. Also altered the code to use an abstraction layer. In plain english, we can now update and fix issues without having to update all other of our scripts at the same time. Meaning you get faster and more regular updates! In this update we have also added some default plain color materials that can you used by you and will be use in our other scripts demo scenes. | 
   | 29/10/2023 | Update to docuemnt and code to improve the V2.0.0 version of core. The New version is V2.1.0 and now TMC core supports Scriptable Objects for an upcoming new asset. Also Improved the TMC Core code to be over multiple files and namespaces to improve performance and readability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
